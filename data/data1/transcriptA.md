TRANSCRIPT A- Participant Caucasian, Female, 4th Year

Interviewer: Okay, Let's start off with question number one. "Many students believe that UCLA is a very diverse place with students of different backgrounds, including different racial and ethnic backgrounds. In your opinion, do students talk about their differences with regard to race/ethnicity?"

Participant: "Hmm, I would definitely say that at UCLA I hear a lot about people talking about the differences of race and ethnicity, especially within my major because obviously Chicano Chicana Studies, a lot of it is about race and ethnicity. But of course, I hear about it within my sorority; obviously, the viewpoints are going to be very different.

Interviewer: How so?

Participant: I think that me being White and also being a Chicana Chicano Studies major, like I see two different worlds. Like within the sorority I'm with a lot of White girls who are pretty privileged in their lives, so they have never necessarily even thought of what it would be like to be another race or the embedded racism that exists in our country. And so with being a Chicano Studies major, like I have gotten to see that and how other people do not see it [racism]. But you know, people of course think racism is common.

Interview: within where?

Participant: Within the sorority. Yeah, I mean [pause] I mean most of it is in joking. I've never heard someone seriously say a racist slur and really mean it, hmm. Or at least they wouldn't do it in front of me because I would be like, "Wait! Let's talk about this. That's inappropriate" [Laughs]. I mean, like when that whole "Asians in the library" thing happened, we talked about that a lot and what that was about.

Interviewer: Did you all have a meeting or something?

Participant: No, the sorority didn't have a meeting; it was more of a general discussion like, "Darn, can you believe what that girl said?" kind of thing. A lot of people didn't feel bad for her; most of the people were like, "Whoa, she's really stupid." I thought that was good because the responses could have gone either way.

Interview: What about those discussions that occur in your classes? You said they were a little bit different, how so?

Participant: Well, I mean, in class, we're talking about the realities of racism, like the entities beyond the government and throughout history, I mean back to colonialism. Especially with Latinos, the racism they experience. I mean, it's all throughout history, and that's all the racial consciousness that Chicano studies bring up.

Interviewer: Okay, so let me rewind a little and go back to the question a bit. Do you think conversations between students of different racial backgrounds are occurring?

Participant: Within the sorority, I mean, yeah, I think they do. I think it depends on the people, and we have some really intellectual girls in the sorority, and others that are not so much. I mean, it's not that they aren't intellectual, but I think it's more that they don't care as much to talk about race. We have some girls that will get into discussions; I mean, I've gotten into some discussions with some girls as well. Like this one girl, she's a Republican. And so she's a pretty strong Republican, and I'm a pretty strong Democrat, so we'll get into discussions, and it was just surprising to see her viewpoints on race and on welfare and other ethnicities in general. It was kind of shocking, and I think it changed my perception of her.

Interviewer: Because you were able to hear her point of view?

Participant: Yeah, I think it has changed negatively about her. Yeah, because of how ignorant she is of a lot of issues. Like, I've tried to talk to her about it, but yeah. Like she's part of Bruin Republicans, and like the conversation was really hard, like her being my sister and her thinking like this, I don't know, it was just like, "Whoa!"

Interview: Was that the very first time you had ever talked to her about race?

Participant: Yeah, and I mean it had originally started with us talking about political parties because she has like a Ronald Reagan poster hanging over her bed, like, "Whoa, really?" I was like, "You're a big fan of Ronald Reagan?" and then we got into this whole discussion about race and then we started talking about immigration and then Mexicans and Latinos in general. Yeah, it was pretty intense [laughs].

Interviewer: Okay, let's hit the second part of the question. "Do you think that UCLA students are free to talk about their differences? Do you think those spaces are available?"

Participant: I think you have to seek those spaces. I don't think necessarily that those spaces are always available. No, I mean obviously some majors are going to be more open to it [conversation about race] than others. So if like someone is a biology major, they're really gonna have to seek spaces where they can talk about race because maybe like their dorms won't be necessarily open to that, so they might have to seek an organization that welcomes that because they're not gonna get that in their biology classes. They simply wouldn't get the same experience as someone who is in a Chicano Studies major, for example.

Interviewer: So they would have to go out of their way to find these spaces?

Participant: Oh definitely! I mean, often times I see people, even within my sorority, that their majors keep them so specific to the sciences that they never talk about race and racial consciousness. They never even think about the real issues within our society, and it's surprising how my entire major talks about it!

Interviewer: It's surprising how your reality isn't theirs?

Participant: Yeah! It's crazy. They really need to just seek them out.

Interviewer: So if they don't seek out these spaces, you're saying it's almost like they get closed off? Is that what you're trying to say?

Participant: Yeah, big time. Yeah, because I mean, many times like, I was brought up in like, obviously my parents are white, so is my whole family. We don't have any interracial marriages at all. So, for me, there is a lot of things that when I started the Chicano Studies major opened my eyes. I was like, "Wow, maybe I did have preconceived notions and a little bit of racism," and the teacher will point out where all that comes from. So I'm like, "Wow, that makes a lot of sense, and now I understand why I thought that, and why that's so wrong and scary to feel like that." For example, with racial slurs, in High School, it was okay, but then you come to college and you realize that that isn't okay to say.

Interviewer: Okay, so we spoke about how there are different spaces where people do talk about race, and you mentioned that in your classes you all talk about race, but can you speak on the quality of these conversations?

Participant: I mean, I think that if you're in an ethnic studies major, you are going to know how to lead the conversation and know how the conversation works, versus other people.

 Like two Biology majors, they don't necessarily gonna know how to really even start that conversation, let alone why are they talking about that because for them that [race] is not the issue, their whole thing is getting into med school. It's not like they care how racism is and why our society is so embedded with it and why it's not okay, kind of thing.

Interviewer: You mentioned how some people lead the discussions because they have that consciousness, and how you think it's easier for those people to engage in conversations about race because they have so much background. What about personal experiences? Do you think they differ in different spaces?

Participant: Oh yeah, definitely! I mean the conversation that I'm going to have with fellow classmates in the Chicano Studies department and the friends I've made with students in the major are going to be completely different from the ones I have here within my sorority or even at home. I mean, I'm constantly teaching my parents stuff that I learn here at UCLA about race and racial consciousness that they have never ever heard of in their life. Like, you know, they were never introduced to it; their parents didn't bring up issues of race, they've never necessarily been the target of racism. So people that are aware of the true issues of racism, conversations with them are going to be more intellectual because we are gonna be able to dig deeper into what the issue is, versus me teaching somebody that there is an issue. So like within the sorority, they don't know what we talk about in my classes.

Interviewer: Do you think they should know?

Participant: Absolutely. I think everyone should be required to take Chicano Studies classes! [laughs] Or ethnic studies classes in general. I mean, with Chicano Studies, it's obviously not only about Chicanos, we talk about Asian Americans, African Americans, every race and racism in general. So yes, I absolutely think that it should be required. And those GE [General Education] courses, I think some of them you can take an ethnic studies course to cover it, but I think it should be required. You shouldn't be able to get out of them by taking another course. I think every student should have to take one and open their mind to it, regardless if they want to or not, they should be taught it.

Interviewer: So you're saying that we have to force people to enter those spaces so that they can gain some exposure?

Participant: Exactly! So that then they can make their opinions from there, and if they still want to keep their racist views, then at least they were taught. At least they were educated, and they were given the other side [other perspective].

Interviewer: A new or different perspective

Participant: Right, exactly.
