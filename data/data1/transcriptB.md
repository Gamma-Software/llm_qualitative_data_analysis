TRANSCRIPT B- INTERVIEW 5B: Taiwanese-American, Male, 4th Year

Interviewer: Okay great. So moving more into the discussion, many students at UCLA believe UCLA is very diverse with students from many different backgrounds, including different racial and ethnic backgrounds. But in your opinion, do you think students talk openly about difference in regards to race and ethnicity?

Participant: I think it depends on the space that they are in.

Interviewer: What do you mean by the space?

Participant: The venue. Oftentimes, when I was living in the dorms we wouldn't talk about those kinds of things, but later I joined student government and we were more open about those kinds of things.

Interviewer: Great, why do you believe there is that difference between the dorm environment and the student government environment?

Participant: Well, I think it's both a difference in the people there, as well as in the environment. In the dorms, people are there to live, and they have their own life goals and things going on, but if you enter the student government environment, you have people who are particularly invested in affairs that are related to cultures, race, and differences, so I guess it would only be natural that they would have those conversations there.

Interviewer: Any other experiences of spaces on campus where you have witnessed students talking about difference on campus?

Participant: I can't really think of one. Usually when I do hear it, it is usually somewhere that is very, I don't know, spaces on campus that are more liberal, like the student activities center, for example, or Kerckhoff Hall, but never in other buildings really.

Interviewer: And do you believe students are free to talk about their difference?

Participant: I don't think so actually. UCLA is such a big school that it's hard to get a feel for the climate people are interacting in. So it is hard to bring up touchy subjects with someone, unless you are on that really close friendship level, which is hard to make many of those connections on such a big campus.

Interviewer: What would you say it takes to develop that connection or trust?

Participant: I guess just friendship I would say. That is really all there is too it, eventually you are comfortable to do anything you want with your friends.

Interviewer: So it only occurs within friend groups you are saying?

Participant: Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. And, have you ever witnessed students with "differences" discussing them or is it mainly students within their same social identity group?

Participant: I would say that I have never seen students actively discussing differences between their identity groups, and the only time I have seen students is when they identify the same as they do, and they are talking about another group of people outside their identity group.

Interviewer: Do you have an example of that?

Participant: All the time at work. I work on the Hill. I hear people make really offensive comments. Things that would not be well received by people within that community. Like people will drop the "N" word, or people will jokingly drop the three-letter "F" word pertaining to gay people, etc., etc. It is silly because they are first years and they don't really understand the impact those words have yet, but that is where I hear a lot of it.

Interviewer: What do you think facilitates dialogue between these different groups or students?

Participant: It is difficult. I mean if you could do that we wouldn't really have racism anymore. But, I think the biggest way of facilitating it is having people have a really empathetic heart and an open mind.

Interviewer: And I guess on the flip side what prevents that dialogue from happening?

Participant: There are just so many societal kind of taboos, you just don't want to anger the other person by giving them your ignorant viewpoint, so even though you may know that you are ignorant, you'd rather just not discuss the topic at all rather than bringing up something that could be inflammatory.

Interviewer: Do you have any personal examples where you have been involved in these kinds of situations?

Participant: Well, yeah. I would say so. With my ex-girlfriend, that was very uncomfortable because she was not aware that I had come to the realization that I was gay. So it made me very uncomfortable to talk about that with her and the people who were around her. So rather than bring up an inflammatory subject and have all these questions bombarded at me, and having to defend myself, I rather opted to just act like nothing was wrong, act like everything was the same and not bring up the subject altogether.

Participant: Well, there are lots of times when I was dating someone, and we would often be stopped by random people and they would be like, "Oh, you guys are so cute together," because we were gay and that would make us feel comfortable, but then other times we would feel very uncomfortable just walking around together because we would get all these nasty glares, but I don't know if that's really applicable to people actually talking about difference on campus. One time someone actually came up to us and started talking about the bible, and that was very inflammatory.

Interviewer: Was he a student?

Participant: Yes, he was.

Interviewer: So you kind of are saying that sometimes these smaller things trigger or inhibit you from feeling comfortable talking with others about difference on campus?

Participant: I would say so.

Interviewer: Great. And again, any other spaces on campus that this happens? You mentioned the hill or student government, or the student activities center. I know you are a South Campus major, do you talk about this in your classes, with your friends in class?

Participant: No, definitely not. Especially in South Campus the environment is very different than the environment in North Campus. We are very focused on our studies and I would say that most of my friendships I have made in the classroom context are very superficial. We are friends, and I would consider them that, but they don't approach personal subjects with me very often, and I don't approach personal subjects with them very often because it's not really related to what we study, and it doesn't affect our performance in the context to when we see each other in class. I would say that I don't know anything about them really, other than what they look like, what their grades are, and what their major is.

Interviewer: Interesting. I guess, moving on from places on campus, and more to experiences you've had where you actually have been talking openly with people about difference. Have you ever talked with someone from a different background about it?

Participant: All the time.

Interviewer: Okay. Can you maybe share one of those experiences and what it was like?

Participant: Well, I was involved in student government like I said, and one of the people involved was very active in the Pilipino community and he was constantly mentioning their struggles and why they, for instance, had a program in SAC and I would ask him, why do Pilipinos or Pacific Islanders receive these kinds of services whereas Chinese people who have historically also been repressed don't get the same treatment in any context. And, we had a discussion, it was very civil, and it really opened my eyes to the many struggles his community faced, and he also challenged

 me to, if these struggles are something that my community has had in the past, then by all means we should have the right to have those services ourselves, so it was very enlightening.

Interviewer: Good, and what kind of prompted you to feel comfortable having that conversation with him?

Participant: Oh, he was a very good friend and mentor. He was a very approachable guy who helped me along through a lot of my personal life so I felt very comfortable discussing anything with him. He always had such an open door, and openness with how he approached subjects with us.

Interviewer: And this sounds like a very unique setting in student government. Why do you think a setting like that allows students to feel comfortable talking about these differences, whereas you mentioned earlier in many cases it's people within their own identity group talking about it?

Participant: I mean like I said, people join student government because they want to advocate on behalf of their community, so it would be plain foolish if someone interested in advocating for their community isn't willing to listen to someone else advocating for their community and so student government facilitates that kind of discussion because everyone is interested, and a part of advocacy is listening to others' struggles to see where the needs of the student population may be.

Interviewer: Great. If you could imagine a UCLA where students talked openly about their differences with others, how do you think that could be achieved?

Participant: It is a very difficult question and there is not a good answer, but an idea that I could come up with is something like, I am hesitant to mention it, but I know a while back in student government we mentioned something like a diversity requirement and I thought that was great because you can't reallyâ€¦ I came from a very not challenged background, so when I came to college I didn't understand the difficulties others faced. It seemed unfathomable really, like I couldn't understand, I thought everyone was full of BS. It didn't hit me until I actually met one of those people and worked through their struggles, and came to understand them, and experienced my own struggle, that I could finally appreciate the differences we all have in our backgrounds, so I think that's a necessary component to catalyze those kinds of discussions of difference.
