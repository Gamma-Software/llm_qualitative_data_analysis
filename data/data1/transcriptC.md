TRANSCRIPT C- Armenian, Female, 3rd Year

Interviewer: So for my first question if you need me to rephrase it let me know. Many students believe that UCLA is a very diverse place, with students of different backgrounds including different racial/ethnic backgrounds. In your opinion, do students talk about their differences with regard to race and ethnicity?

Participant: I’d say yeah they do. And I would agree that there is a lot of diversity here. But when I first came to UCLA I didn’t really see it I was just thinking there were a bunch of Asians and White people everywhere. But when once you get into your classes and you go into UCLA whether it’s a job or volunteer opportunities then you really see that there are different races. Like I didn’t know Persian Jews existed until I came to UCLA and a lot of people I have met here happen to be Persian Jews but I really didn’t realize that. But does that answer your question? You asked about differences with other people?

Interviewer: Yeah, well whether people of different backgrounds do happen to talk about those differences.

Participant: Well, yeah the people I do talk to. I guess it depends who you talk to and where. I know at work we talk about how my culture is different from yours or what we do for holidays. Like if I find out someone is a different culture in class I’ll ask them about it and questions. But yeah I think it’s about differences until you get to the similarities and realize oh yeah we do have a lot of similarities and stuff in common.

Interviewer: And why do you think those conversations happen at work?

Participant: At work I feel like we are more tightly knit. It feels more like a family rather than work at my workplace [Laughs]. Everyone is really comfortable with each other and I mean we have a lot of different races like Armenian, Spanish, we have a lot of Asians in there and African-Americans. It’s just really a diverse group and once you have a group like that of people working together in a small environment it's bound to happen.

Interviewer: So do you think all UCLA students are free to talk about their differences?

Participant: Well, I mean I don’t know maybe some cultures have limitations. Or they are not allowed to. And I don’t think I have ever met someone who didn’t discuss or choose to talk about their backgrounds.

Interviewer: And at work you feel comfortable talking about your differences with any person?

Participant: Yeah, pretty much.

Interviewer: Well you mentioned that these conversations occur at work but could you think of anywhere else where these conversations occur? Or talk about a personal experience?

Participant: Yeah well in the dorms a lot but now that I moved out I feel less connected to UCLA so I think it's harder to talk to people. But especially because I’m Armenian I feel like anytime I interact with someone who is not Armenian they either don’t know about my race or they never heard about it or I don’t know they’re curious about it. So I feel like it’s really easy for me to talk to people in the classroom if I have someone in one or more of my classes. I’ll approach them and ask them then one thing leads to another and you talk about your race/ethnicity. So I don’t think it's really hard for me personally but I don’t know I would say the dorms, jobs, but I’m not really involved in any outside club or activities. So I feel like Bruinwalk with all the clubs and organizations there is a lot of opportunity here.

Interviewer: And these conversations occur in class but are they facilitated by anyone?

Participant: In class the only two examples that I’ve experienced was in my race and ethnicity class where that was a central topic of it. So that was really interactive and race/ethnicity was the main topic obviously and that’s basically what we talked about. But again, aside from classes based on that if I see other students in more than one class of mine and especially my name. It’s not a common name so that opens an entire field of where it comes from or several other questions about my ethnicity. And from this it goes back and forth.

Interviewer: Okay, thanks. But do you think there’s also anything that prevents people from having these conversations about their differences?

Participant: Well maybe embarrassment or fear. Some people might be scared to talk about themselves and I’m sure it happens because if I were say Muslim I don’t know how open I would be to having people come into my life and discussing. There are a lot of people like that but its just happens that I’m not one of them. But I’m sure there are a lot of stigmas and prejudices that might prevent people.

Interviewer: So when you talk to other people do you feel that you are honest when you talk about your culture and differences? And that they are the same way?

Participant: Yeah for the most part I mean it depends who I’m talking to and how far I want to go with the conversation. If I just met you I am not going to talk to you about how Armenians can’t have sex until they’re married or you know my family is this certain way. It's not like I’ll go all out and give you a full-blown background of my culture but workwise or friendwise that I’m pretty open. And I believe they are too, for the most part. But then again you never know.

Interviewer: Ok, so if you could characterize the quality of interaction between people of different backgrounds to someone who doesn’t go to UCLA, what would you say?

Participant: I’m sorry could you repeat that.

Interview: Yeah, so if you were to explain to someone who doesn’t go to UCLA like a prospective student or whatever, how would you explain the way people interact on campus in terms of their differences? Since you did say earlier it’s a diverse place.

Participant: Well, I would say organizations but then again I have never participated but I know there are a lot of clubs and groups that culturally mix. I mean I have seen a lot of that happen with Armenians and another group like I recently got an email about an Armenian/Brazilian dance things. Which is so random but here at UCLA we have the opportunities and we have the cultures and so many different people that come together so I feel like our clubs and organizations are a way. I do feel that also international students open the door since we have so many of them this year and they are from all over the world so that’s another benefit I guess to UCLA. It makes it more diverse.

Interviewer: So since you said you have had good experiences talking about your Armenian culture, what makes you want to share that with people?

Participant: I would say pride would be one of them. Great pride in being Armenian. I feel like its important and special and really close to me because it defines who I am as a person. So I feel like if I open up my culture people get a better sense of who I am. In terms of moral, religion, food, family gatherings describes me.
