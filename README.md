# Qualitative Data Analysis 📝
This is a tool to help you do your qualitative data analysis. 🧐
This can for instance take your transcripts and generate codes and themes for you. 💡

# 🔬 Tech stack
The Qualitative Data Analysis uses [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) or Large Language Models to generate the summary / codes / themes and classify them. 🤖
The application is developped with Python.

## Python Libraries
This tool is powered by libraries:
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io): For the User Interface 🖥️
- [Langchain](https://langchain.com): For creating LLMs applications 🔗

# Features ✨
- Upload your transcripts 📂
- Generate Summary on all data or on a specific data 📊
- Based on a research question generate a summary of the data, generate codes and themes. ❓
- Update Qualitative Analysis Data parameters 🔄
- Generate a Qualitative Data Analysis report and download it 📄

# Limitations ⚠️
- For now, the tool cannot perform a Qualitative Data Analysis on large datasets as the LLM used is limited to 16000 tokens. 🚫
- The data is not cached and the report as well. So if you reset the page the data will have to be uploaded and the report regenerated again. 🔄

# Improvements 🚀
- Upload voice transcripts and convert them to text and perform a Qualitative Data Analysis 🗣️
- Connect to Qualitative Data softwares 🤝
- (double check) Do intermediates checkings on the results to avoid LLM bias 🤔
- Perform map-refine summary on the data
- Handle large data transcripts

# Background 🧑‍🎓
My name is [Valentin Rudloff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudloffvalentin/) and I'm a Engineer. I make stuff in various fields. 👨‍🔧
For my wife's memoire, she needed a tool to help her do a Qualitative Data Analysis on transcripts she conducted. 📚
LLMs are really good at understanding human semantics and thus perform a Qualitative Data Analysis. 🧠
This application helped her get almost an instant result, and I'm pretty sure this can help you as well. 👍
